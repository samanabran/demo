"""PROP-D7 (P2 data-integrity) -- inbound feed currency resolution must
never silently substitute the company currency for a currency the feed
did not (or could not) specify correctly.

Business rule, confirmed 2026-09-05: property.details.currency_id has a
create-time default (the current company's currency). That default is
appropriate when a feed genuinely supplies no currency information at
all, but is financially misleading when a feed DID supply a currency
code and it simply failed to resolve (e.g. a stale/unsupported ISO code,
a typo, or a placeholder like "XXX") -- silently relabeling that price
as the company's currency would misstate the listing's actual value.

Three distinct outcomes are covered, matching resolve_related_records()
in models/portal/inbound_feed_service.py:
  1. Recognized currency code -> currency_id resolves to that currency.
  2. No currency code in the feed at all -> currency_id is left to the
     model's own default (company currency) -- no signal was given, so
     there is nothing to contradict.
  3. An unrecognized/unresolvable currency code -> currency_id is
     explicitly left unset (False), NOT defaulted, and a warning is
     logged as the operator-facing review signal.

Agent-created verification tests, added alongside the PROP-D7 fix
(commit 66c5862) as its regression test.
