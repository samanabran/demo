"""PROP-D12 (P2 usability/data-integrity) -- property.details' Pricing &
Fees tab (dld_fee, admin_fee, total_customer_obligation) sat next to
dld_fee_percentage/admin_fee_percentage with no compute or onchange wired
up at all -- an operator had to manually calculate and type each amount,
with no auto-suggestion from price or the percentage fields, and no
enforcement that dld_fee actually matched price * dld_fee_percentage.
Reported live by a user testing the property form.

Confirmed decision (asked and answered): auto-suggest via @api.onchange,
fields stay plain and manually overridable (not compute=/readonly) --
tenant B already has live properties with real, manually-entered values
in these fields, and forcing a hard compute would silently overwrite them
on the next module upgrade.

Booking amount (booking_wizard.book_price) gets the same auto-suggest
treatment from property.details.booking_percentage, covered separately
below since it lives on a different model (the wizard).

Agent-created verification tests, added alongside the PROP-D12 fix. Uses
odoo.tests.common.Form to genuinely simulate the web client's onchange
execution, not a direct method call -- this is the actual mechanism the
reported symptom (fields not updating live in the form) runs through.
