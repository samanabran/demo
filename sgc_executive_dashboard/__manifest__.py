SGC Executive Command Center
=============================
A single source of truth for executive decision making. Aggregates live KPIs
from every installed SGC/Odoo application (real estate, construction, deals,
commission, CRM & sales, purchase, finance, HR & UAE payroll, compliance/KYC,
projects, learning, video conferencing) and surfaces dormant applications as
capability gaps, without hard dependencies on any business module.

Also includes an AI command layer: one-click preset briefings (board pack,
cash risk, pipeline health, anomaly scan), free-text business questions
answered against a safety-validated, allowlisted query engine, and a
global Ctrl+K command-palette integration.
