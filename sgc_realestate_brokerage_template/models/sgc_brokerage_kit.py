    """Curated bundle of audit-cleared real-estate modules.

    A *kit* is the canonical way to express the real-estate brokerage + ERP
    rollout for a vertical scope. Each kit has a static list of recommended
    addons (one row per module name) and a recommended ``depends`` ordering
    for a Docker-compose build.

    The kit object is **declarative**: code does not consume kits at
    runtime. Instead, the ``docs/REAL_ESTATE_BROKERAGE_ROLLOUT.md``
    playbook uses kits as the *menu-of-options* for each rollout phase,
    and the audit lint tool uses them as a reference for the canonical
    per-vertical addon-path.
