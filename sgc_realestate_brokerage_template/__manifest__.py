SGC Realestate Brokerage Template
=================================

A reusable, audit-driven template for any real-estate brokerage tenant. It does
*not* ship a full ERP — it ships the **onboarding skeleton**, the **parametrised
defaults**, and the **tenant lifecycle hooks** that wire an existing SGC estate
into a per-tenant real-estate brokerage deployment.

Architecture
------------

1.  ``sgc.brokerage.tenant`` (model ``sgc_realestate_brokerage_template``) —
    the per-tenant record. One row per real-estate tenant. Holds the
    enablement flags for: core (sales, lead-scoring, listings, deals,
    commission); growth (CRM dashboard, nurture, broker portal); and ERP
    rollout (AML, KYC, offplan rental, construction gating, payroll).

2.  ``sgc.brokerage.kit`` — the bundle-selection model. Each
    ``kit`` is a curated subset of the SGC estate proven to compose for a
    vertical (brokerage-core, offplan-rental, construction, recurring-Mgmt).
    Kits are referenced from M2O on the tenant.

3.  ``ir.config_parameter`` defaults — the placeholder values that the
    template ships. Real values are filled in by the tenant onboarding
    wizard (see ``onboarding_*.xml`` in companion addons) before first use.

4.  SQL/CSV preflight checks — each model in this addon exposes a
    ``*_preflight_check()`` method that the audit's

    ::

        tools/audit_coupling_lint.py

    surfaces. See ``docs/audit/MULTI_TENANT_BLOCKERS.md`` for the M1/M3/M5
    inventory this template is designed to be compatible with.

Compliance
----------

This addon references the audit's hold list (``30_QUARANTINE/README.md``) by
exact ``excludes`` entry above. **No held module is in ``depends``** — the
template composes only audit-cleared modules from
``docs/audit/MODULE_PROVENANCE.md``.

Hardcoded emails and localhost URLs that the audit's
``audit_out/coupling_findings.csv`` flagged have been replaced by
``ir.config_parameter`` lookups in this template. See
``data/ir_config_parameter_defaults.xml`` for the canonical key list.

Rollout phases
--------------

This template is the entry point for ``docs/REAL_ESTATE_BROKERAGE_ROLLOUT.md``,
which describes eight phases of a real-estate brokerage deployment.

The ``sequence = 100`` above keeps the template at the top of any addon-index
that sorts by sequence, so the kit-selector menu entry is visible early in any
real-estate vertical installation.
